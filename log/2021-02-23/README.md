Starting a udemy course that was reocmmended by a developer friend. This
i am told is what i am missing my programming hobby, a full
understanding of data structures. 

this seems to be a deeper dive into how all of the data stuctures work,
using c. the point of using C is once you understand how it all works
under the hood it will hopfeully be able to pick up un future languages.
